🌱 KnowsNav – Accessibility-First Description

KnowsNav is an accessibility-focused, hands-free interaction technology designed to help individuals with disabilities navigate, write, and communicate on the internet without the use of a mouse or keyboard.

By translating facial movement into precise cursor control and dwell-based interaction, KnowsNav enables users to browse the web, enter text, and engage with digital content using natural, non-invasive motion. The system is built to support users with limited mobility, repetitive strain injuries, or conditions that make traditional input devices difficult or impossible to use.

KnowsNav prioritizes dignity, independence, and ease of use. Its architecture preserves reliability while allowing users to adjust sensitivity, speed, and interaction modes to match their personal comfort and abilities. The result is a flexible assistive technology that adapts to the user — not the other way around.

KnowsNav is free to use and designed to expand digital access through thoughtful, human-centered engineering.

Initial KnowsNav release – proprietary, free to use

KnowsNav

KnowsNav is a free, hands-free accessibility system that enables users to
navigate and write using facial movement.

It combines two independent technologies — EyeWrite and SnazyCam —
through a dedicated integration driver that links cursor data while preserving
each underlying system intact and unmodified.

KnowsNav is designed for accessibility, autonomy, and dignity in human–computer
interaction.

Key Principles

Hands-free navigation and text entry
